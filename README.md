Currently NOT working:
Notification redirect: tapping on a notification brings you to the home screen but resets the view
Notification user and user location


NEW stuff:
User database: In order to log in, you have to create an account and then sign in with email and password
User session, you no longer have to sign back in to app when leaving app
Notifications sounds, banner, and info
Map auto locates to Orlando, FL
All other views work with no issues
Sign out pop up, actually logs you out
